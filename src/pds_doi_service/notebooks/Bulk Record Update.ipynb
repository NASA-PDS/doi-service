    "# PDS DOI Service Bulk Record Update Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is provided as a utility for performing bulk updates over a number of DOI records sourced from DataCite. It assumes some familiarity with using the PDS DOI Service as well as the DataCite DOI record format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bulk updates may be performed with this notebook in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the query parameters for acquring the set of records to be updated\n",
    "* Run the DOI Service List action to obtain the set of records in a single JSON label. This label will also be parsed into an in-memory representation of `Doi` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, there are two means of performing bulk updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to make updates on the JSON label directly, write the label to disk, make the desired updates, then commit the updated label to the local transaction database and DataCite.\n",
    "* If you want to write code to modify in-memory representations of the records, modify the cell under the **Perform Bulk Update(s) in Memory** cell to perform the desired changes. After all in-memory records are processed, they are reformed into a single JSON label. This label may then be written to disk and used to commit the changes to the local database or DataCite.\n",
