        Review -
            DOI request has all metadata assigned by the Discipline Node and is
            ready for review by the Engineering Node.

            DOI request has been reviewed by Engineering Node and released
            (submitted to DOI service provider), but not yet published.

            DOI request has been registered with the service provider.

            DOI request has been marked as "findable" by DataCite, meaning it
            is publicly available.

            The submitted DOI has been deactivated (deleted).
