            DOI reserve request submitted, but not yet published/released.
        Draft -
            DOI request stored as draft in local database to allow additional
            metadata to be assigned before review request is made.
        Review -
            DOI request has all metadata assigned by the Discipline Node and is
            ready for review by the Engineering Node.
        Pending -
            DOI request has been reviewed by Engineering Node and released
            (submitted to DOI service provider), but not yet published.
        Registered -
            DOI request has been registered with the service provider.
            Note that for DataCite entries, registered must still be pushed
            to "Findable" to be considered published.
        Findable -
            DOI request has been marked as "findable" by DataCite, meaning it
            is publicly available.
        Deactivated -
            The submitted DOI has been deactivated (deleted).
