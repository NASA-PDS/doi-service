# This file is used with docker-compose.yml to specify a number of environment
# variable key/value pairs to add to the DOI Service's environment when
# launching the container via docker compose up.

# The DOI Service prioritizes environment variables over the included INI,
# so this file may be used to inject credentials or any other supported
# options into the DOI Service when in a containerized context.

# The naming convention for expected environment variables follows from the
# format of the INI, where the section name and option name are concatenated
# with an underscore and converted to uppercase, for example:

#   OSTI_USER=username -> overrides the "user" option of the [OSTI] INI section.

# If the default values from the bundled INI are desired, do not specify
# environment variables for them here or they will be overridden.

# Also note that Docker performs "no special handling of quotation marks" for
# values. This means that they become part of the value provided to the DOI Service.
