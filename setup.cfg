# Ignoring:
# E203 prevents flake8 from complaining about whitespace around slice
# components. Black formats per PEP8 and flake8 doesn't like some of
# this.
#
# E501 prevents flake8 from complaining line lengths > 79. We will use
# flake8-bugbear's B950 to handle line length lint errors. This trips
# when a line is > max-line-length + 10%.
#
# W503 is ignored for ``pds-doi-service`` not just because it makes use of
# left-aligned binary operators in multi-line expressions, but because the
# opposite advice is now the recommended practice; see
